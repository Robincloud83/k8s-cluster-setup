### Install Kubernetes

###  Step 1: Add Kubernetes Signing Key
### Since Kubernetes comes from a non-standard repository, download the signing key to ensure the software is authentic.
###  On each node, use the curl command to download the key and store it in a safe place (default is /etc/apt/keyrings/:

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

####  Step 2: Add Software Repositories
####   Kubernetes is not included in the default Ubuntu repositories. To add the Kubernetes repository to your list, enter this command on each node:
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt update

###   Step 3: Install Kubernetes Tools
####  Each Kubernetes deployment consists of three separate tools:

### Kubeadm. A tool that initializes a Kubernetes cluster by fast-tracking the setup using community-sourced best practices.
####  Kubelet. The work package that runs on every node and starts containers. The tool gives you command-line access to clusters.
#### Kubectl. The command-line interface for interacting with clusters.
#### Execute the following commands on each server node to install the Kubernetes tools:

##  1. Run the install command:
sudo apt install kubeadm kubelet kubectl



#####    Run these cmds on k8s master and worker's server
